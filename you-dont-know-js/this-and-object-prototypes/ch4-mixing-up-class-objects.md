# Chapter 4. Mixing (Up) "Class" Objects

- Classes are a design pattern

- In general, faking classes in JS often sets more landmines for future coding than solving present real problems.

## Class Theory

## Class Mechanics

**Building**

**Constructor**

## Class Inheritance

**Polymorphism**

**Multiple Inheritance**

## Mixins

- There are no "classes" in Javascript to instantiate, only objects. And objects don't get copied to other objects, they get linked together.

- Mixins: How JS developers fake the missing copy behavior of classes in Javascript.

**Explicit Mixins**

Polymorphism revisited

Mixing copies

Parasitic inheritance

**Implicit Mixins**
