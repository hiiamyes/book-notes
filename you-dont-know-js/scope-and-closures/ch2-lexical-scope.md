# Chapter 2. Lexical Scope

There are two predominant models for how scope works:

- Lexical Scope
- Dynamic Scope

## Lex-time

Lexical scope it scope that is defined at lexing time.

Lexical scope is based on where variables and blocks of scope are authered by you at write time, and thus is (mostly) set in stone by the time the lexer processes your code.

**Look-ups**

Scope look-up stops once it finds the first match.

The lexical scope look-up process only applies to first-classs identifiers.

## Cheating Lexical

Frowned upon.

Javascript has two such mechanisms.

The most important point: cheating lexical scope leads to poorer performance.
