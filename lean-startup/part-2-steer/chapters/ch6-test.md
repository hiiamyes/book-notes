Andrew Mason, the founder of Groupon, tells the story: We took a WordPress Blog and we skinned it to say Groupon and then every day we would do a new post.

Unlike a prototype or concept test, an MVP is designed not just to answer product design or technical questions. It's goal is to test fundamental business hypotheses.

## WHY FIRST PRODUCTS AREN'T MEANT TO BE PERFECT

The gross numbers were small because we were selling the product to visionary early customers called early adopters.

Early adopters use their imagination to fill in what a product is missing. They prefer that state of affairs, because what they care about above all is being the first to use or adopt a new product or technology.

Only at the point where the founders were too busy to bring on additional customers did Manuel and his team start to invest in automation in the form of product development.

In a concierge MVP, this personalized service is not the product but a learning activity designed to test the leap-of-faith assumptions in the company's growth model.
