# Chapter 2: How we really use the Web

The difference between how we think people use websites and how they actually use them.

User's reality is much more closer to "billboard going by at 60 mile an hour."

Three facts about real-world Web use:

1. We don't read page. We sacn them.

   - We're usually on a mission.
   - We know we don't need to read everything.
   - We're good at it.

1. We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice.

   - We're usually in a hurry.
   - There's not much of a penalty for guessing wrong.
   - Weighing options may not improve our chances.
   - Guessing is more fun.

1. We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through.
   - It's not important to us.
   - If we find something that works, we stick to it.
