# Chapter 3: Billboard Design 101

Designing for sacnning, not for reading.

## Conventions are your friends

- Convention: Widely used or standardized design pattern.
- One problem with conventions, though: Designers are often reluctant to take advantage of them.
- You can and should be as creative and innovative as you want, and add as much aesthetic appeal as you can, as long as you make sure it's still usable.
- Clarity trumps consistency.

## Create effective visual hierarchies

## Break up pages into clearly defined areas

## Make it obvious what's clickable

## Keep the noise down to dull roar

- Shouting
- Disorganization
- Clutter

## Format text to support scanning
